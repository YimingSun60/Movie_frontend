## Language/Framework
- **Flutter:** We use Flutter, a versatile UI toolkit by Google, for building natively compiled applications for mobile, web, and desktop from a single codebase.
- **Backend Communication:** http: For network communication and data exchange with our backend services, we utilize the http package. This allows us to make HTTP requests to RESTful APIs, handle responses, and seamlessly integrate our frontend with server-side data processing and storage solutions.


## Future Plan
The improvment will focus on the realm of visual design. Here are the key areas we'll be focusing on:

### Enhancing Visual Effects

- **UI/UX improvment**: Makine the interface more intuitive and visually appealing, aligning with the latest trends in UI/UX design.

- **Animation and Interactivity**: Integrating animations to make the app more lively and interactive, thereby improving user engagement.

- **Theme and Color Scheme**: Refining our color palette and introducing adaptable themes, including dark and light modes, to enhance visual comfort and accessibility.

- **Performance Optimization**: Ensuring that visual enhancements do not compromise the app's performance, maintaining swift and responsive interactions.
